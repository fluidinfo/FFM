FluidDB Fluid Monitor

Some proof-of-concept code that shows how to connect an Arduino to FluidDB. In
this case we're measuring the moisture reading of a flower-pot. :-)

This is very early-stage stuff and we have plans to build something much more
modular and robust that includes documentation and examples - but you have to
start somewhere...

To make it work please make sure you set the values in the line that currently reads:

  char user_pass[] = "USERNAME:PASSWORD";

with the appropriate username / password values.
